<strong>Ayurveda - harmony of body, mind and soul </strong><br />
    <br />
    Sprouted in the pristine land of India some 5000 years ago, Ayurveda,   the science of life and longevity, is the oldest healthcare system in   the world and it combines the profound thoughts of medicine and   philosophy. Since then Ayurveda has stood for the wholesome physical,   mental and spiritual growth of humanity around the world. Today, it's a   unique, indispensable branch of medicine, a complete naturalistic system   that depends on the diagnosis of your body's humours - vata, pitta and   kapha - to achieve the right balance. <br />

    <strong>Kerala, the Land of Ayurveda </strong><br />
    <br />
    Kerala possesses an unbroken tradition of Ayurveda that has surpassed   the many invasions and intrusions both foreign and native. For hundreds   of years the Ayurveda Vaidyas (traditional practitioners of Ayurveda)   were almost the only access for people seeking healing from every kind   of disease in Kerala. The legendary eight families of Vaidyas (Ashta   vaidyas) and their successors treated the entire state for centuries.   Unlike the other Indian states the status of Ayurveda in Kerala is not   alternative but mainstream. In fact, today, Kerala is the only State in   India which practices this system of medicine with absolute dedication. <br />
    <br />
    Being the only resort of treatment for the people, the Vaidyars of   Kerala were challenged to interpret the theories of Ayurveda and adapt   them actively into effective healing systems in everyday life. Thus   almost all the contemporary procedures and protocols of Ayurveda have   evolved in and around Kerala. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>The Boons of Nature </strong><br />
    <br />
    Its equable climate, natural abundance of forests and the cool monsoon   season are best suited for Ayurveda's curative and restorative packages.   Kerala is perhaps one of the few places on earth where a temperature of   24-28 degrees is maintained during a period of continuous rain. This   prevalence of moisture in the air and on the surface of the skin makes   it the ideal place for natural medicines to work at their highest levels   of potency. The land is also blessed with innumerous medicinal plants   and provides the continuity and consistency of Ayurveda medicines needed   for effective treatment procedures. The same herbs with the same   potency are available year after year across every season. The rich   alkaloid content of the soil enhances the intensity and potency of many   Ayurvedic medicines when compared to places with different soil   constitution. <br />

    <strong>The Advantages of Ayurveda in Kerala </strong><br />
    <br />
    <em>Ashtangahridayam</em>, the practical, user friendly interpretation   of Ayurveda, compiled by the great Vagbata is seldom used anywhere in   the world as it is extensively done in Kerala. The Vaidyars of Kerala   are proficient in this most contemporary treatise of Ayurveda which many   scholars consider an advancement over the earlier samhitas of Charaka   and Sushruta, the pioneers of Ayurveda. It is in Kerala that Kashaya   Chikitsa (treatment with concoction) has become a standardised protocol   involving hundreds of Kashayams that were scientifically classified and   organised according to various treatment needs. Keralite Vaidyars where   the first to focus on the anti oxidant properties of <em>Abayangam</em> leading to the profusion of <em>kizhis</em>.   The largest number of Ayurveda colleges and the largest number of   practitioners in comparison to any place in the world has led to a   tradition of Ayurveda research in a scientific manner in Kerala. <br />
    <strong><br />
    Ayurveda as a lifestyle </strong><br />
    <br />
    In Kerala Ayurveda is not just a healthcare system but it is a part and   parcel of every aspect of life, in fact it is a lifestyle in Kerala so   to speak. The miracles like paralysed people walk, incurable diseases   cured etc. that happen even today inspires respect and awe for the   vaidyars of Kerala. <br />
